# West African peanut soup

This spicy peanut soup is a flavorful and nourishing dish that combines the creamy richness of peanut butter with tomato, spices, and greens. While not an authentic recipe, it draws inspiration from traditional groundnut stews found in various West African countries, particularly recipes from [Yumna Jawad](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/peanut-soup/) and [The Modern Proper](https://themodernproper.com/african-peanut-soup).

## Instructions

Chicken (if uncooked, otherwise skip):

1. Cut 1 pound of raw chicken breast or thigh into consistent, 3/4 inch thick slices. Season each side with total of 2 tsp salt and 2 tsp black pepper. Let sit for 10 minutes.

2. Heat 1 tbsp oil in medium pan. Then cook chicken, 4-5 minutes per side, until white and lightly golden. Make sure internal temperature exceeds 165 degrees.


Soup:

3. Chop up a medium red onion. Dice a jalapeño, mince 1 tbsp of ginger, and mince 4 cloves of garlic. Dice up a sweet potato. Chop up 3 cups of greens, either kale or collard greens.

4. Heat 1.5 tbsp oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Add the diced red onion and sauté until softened and translucent.

5. Add the garlic, ginger, jalapeño, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1.5 tsp cumin, and 1/2 cup tomato paste to the pot. Stir well to combine and cook for a couple minutes until fragrant.

6. Pour in 4 cups chicken broth plus 2 cups additional water. Add the sweet potato and 3/4 cup peanut butter. Stir to combine all the ingredients. Bring this mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.

7. Add the chopped kale or collard greens to the pot and continue cooking for a few more minutes until the greens have wilted.

9. Shred chicken with fingers or a fork, and mix into the soup. Let simmer a few more minutes.

8. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if needed by adding more salt or spices.

9. Serve the soup as-is or over cooked millet, brown rice, or quinoa. Garnish with chopped peanuts.
