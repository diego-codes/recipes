# Firecracker tofu lettuce wraps

If you like spicy, peanuty stirfry but want to eat it handheld, then this recipe originally from [Pinch of Yum](https://pinchofyum.com/vegan-lettuce-wraps) is for you!


## Ingredients:

For the sauce:
- 1/2 cup (132g) peanut butter
- 1/3 cup (95ml) low sodium soy sauce
- 1/3 cup (75ml) sesame oil
- 1/4 cup (60ml) rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons (24g) chili paste (like sambal oelek)
- 2 tablespoons (24g) sugar
- 1 small knob of fresh ginger, peeled
- 1 clove of fresh garlic, peeled

For the lettuce wraps:
- 1 container extra firm tofu
- 4 ounces brown rice noodles
- butter lettuce leaves for wrapping

Optional toppings:
- crushed peanuts or cashews
- cilantro
- scallions
- lime
- sriracha


## Instructions

- Soak 4 ounces brown rice noodles in a bowl of lukewarm water for at least 30 minutes while prepping the rest of the recipe. The noodles should become soft and flexible.

- Blend all the sauce ingredients together in a small blender or food processor until smooth and creamy.

- Press the tofu with a few paper towels to get some of the moisture out. Cut the tofu into small pieces. Heat a little oil in a nonstick skillet. Add and sauté tofu at least 15 minutes, until golden brown. Add about half of the sauce to the pan. Stir-fry for another 3-5 minutes. As the sauce browns, it will form small crispy pieces around the tofu. Transfer tofu to a bowl.

- Drain and rinse the noodles. Add another swish of oil to the pan and plop the noodles in. Add about half of the remaining sauce. Stir-fry for two minutes until coated. Add a splash of water if it’s too sticky. Remove from heat immediately and toss with the tofu.

- Fill the butter lettuce leaves with the noodle/tofu mixture (it’s okay if it’s sticky – you’re just wrapping it up in lettuce). Top with peanuts, cashews, cilantro, scallions, lime, and/or sriracha if you want.
