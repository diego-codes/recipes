# Chocolate chip oatmeal cookies

These nutty cookies are inspired by Food Network Kitchen's [oatmeal-flax chocolate chip cookies](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/oatmeal-flax-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe-2106797) and Trader Joe's gluten-free oatmeal cookie recipe (found on the back of their rolled oats).


## Ingredients (for 12 cookies)

- 2 tbsp butter at room temperature
- 3 1/2 tbsp white sugar
- 3 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp vanilla
- 1 tbsp chopped walnuts
- 1/2 tbsp flaxseeds
- 3 tbsp flour
- 1/8 cup peanut butter
- pinch of salt
- pinch of cinnamon
- 1/4 cup chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup rolled oats


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. If the butter (2 tbsp) is cold, soften it without melting it. With a mixer on medium-high, beat the butter with the white sugar (3.5 tbsp) and brown sugar (3 tbsp) until fluffy. Whisk in the egg.

3. Add in the baking soda (1/4 tsp), vanilla (1/4 tsp), chopped walnuts (1 tbsp), flaxseeds (1/2 tbsp), and flour (3 tbsp). Beat until smooth.

4. Beat in the peanut butter (1/8 cup).

5. With a spatula, combine batter with the oats (1/2 cup) and chocolate chips (1/4 cup).

6. Once the oven is heated up, scoop 12 generous spoonfuls of batter onto the parchment paper, about 2 inches apart.

7. Bake for 11 minutes until the edges are lightly brown.

8. When complete, take out of the oven and transfer the cookies to a cooling tray. Enjoy!
