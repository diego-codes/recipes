# Strawberry muffins

These muffins are about as moist and soft as you'll find. If they ever dry out, cut open, add a dab of butter inside, and microwave for 10 seconds. Based on [this recipe](https://www.honeyandbirch.com/springtime-strawberry-muffins/), no glaze necessary.


## Ingredients (for 12 muffins)

- 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 1 egg
- 1/3 - 1/2 cup milk
- 1 cup fresh strawberries, diced into small pieces (the smaller the better)


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a muffin tin with butter or non-stick spray.

2. In your mixing bowl, whisk together the 1.5 cup flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 2 teaspoons of baking powder. Set aside.

3. Pour vegetable oil into a 1 cup measuring cup; add the egg and enough milk to fill the cup with 1 cup of liquid. Whisk the liquid together in the measuring cup, then add it to the mixing bowl. Whisk until just combined - batter should be slightly lumpy. Fold in strawberries with a spatula.

4. Pour batter into muffin tin. Bake for 13 minutes, or until a toothpick stuck in the middle of the muffin comes out clean. Let cool before removing from muffin pan.
