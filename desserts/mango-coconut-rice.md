# Mango coconut rice

This Thai dessert compliments salty and spicy food well. This recipe is inspired by a Food Network [mango coconut rice recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/mango-coconut-rice-recipe-1937791) from Paula Dean and a [caramelized mango recipe](https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/caramelized-mangoes) from MyRecipes.


## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1.5 cups long-grain rice (ideally sushi rice)
- 1 can (14 ounces) unsweetened coconut milk
- 1/2 cup + 1.5 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 large, ripe mango, peeled and cubed (about 2 cups)


## Instructions

1. Peel the ripe mango and cut into cubes, about 1/3 to 1/2 inch per side.

2. Combine 2 tablespoons sugar and 1.5 tablespoons water in a medium pan over medium-high heat; cook until sugar dissolves. Continue cooking 3 minutes or until golden; do not stir. Reduce heat to medium.

3. Add cubed mango to pan, tossing gently. Cook 10 minutes or until mango is lightly browned, stirring frequently.

4. In another large saucepan, heat the tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Stir in the 1.5 cups of rice to coat with the oil.

5. Add the can of coconut milk, 1/2 cup water, and teaspoon of salt; bring to a boil. Stir in the caramelized mango.

6. Cover pan, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 20 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed by the rice.

7. Remove the rice from the heat and fluff with a fork. Place a clean, dry dish towel over the pan, cover with the lid, and let steam for 5 minutes before serving.
