# Thai chile Brussels sprouts

Inspired by Austin's [East Side King](https://www.keyingredient.com/recipes/2265695032/fried-brussel-sprouts-east-side-king/), these Brussels sprouts are tangy, sweet, spicy, perfect.


## Ingredients

- 2 cup jasmine rice, dry
- 1 cup sweet chili sauce, preferably Mae Ploy brand
- 1 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced

2. Place the 1 cup chili sauce, 1 cup vinegar, 1 clove minced garlic, and 4 minced Thai chiles in a small mixing bowl. Mix well and set aside.

3. Heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat.

4. Once the oil is shimmering, add the 1 pound quartered brussels sprouts and cook them until the cores of the sprouts are approaching golden brown and the outside starts to char and get crispy, about 2 - 3 minutes.

5. Toss the 1/2 cup red and 1/2 cup green cabbage, 1/4 cup alfalfa sprouts, 1/4 cup sweet onion, and large jalapeño in a large mixing bowl.

6. Add the brussels sprouts and half of the chili sauce mixture.
