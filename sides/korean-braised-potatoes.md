# Gamja jorim (Korean braised potatoes)

These sweet and spicy potatoes are a great side. Based on a recipe from [Korean Bamsang](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/gamja-jorim-braised-potatoes/).


## Ingredients:

Ingredients:
- 3 medium potatoes (1.5 pounds)
- 1 carrot (3 ounces)
- 3 green chile peppers (alt: 1/2 green bell pepper)
- 1/4 medium onion
- 1 tablespoon cooking oil
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon roasted sesame seeds

Braising liquid:
- 3/4 cup water
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon gochujang paste (alt: use 1 tablespoon extra soy sauce)
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon rice wine (or mirin, omit if unavailable)
- 1 tablespoon corn syrup (or oilgodang, alt: use 1 tablespoon extra sugar)
- 1 teaspoon garlic, minced
- pinch black pepper


## Instructions

1. Peel and cut 3 potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Cut the carrot, 3 chile peppers, and 1/4 onion into big chunks.

2. Mince 1 teaspoon of garlic.

3. In a small bowl, combine all the braising liquid ingredients. Stir well.

4. In a non-stick pan or a small pot, saut√© the potatoes in 1 tablespoon cooking oil over medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally so the potatoes don't stick to the pan.

5. Add the sauce mix and bring to a boil over high heat. Drop the carrot pieces in.

6. Cover, and reduce the heat to medium and cook until the potatoes are almost cooked through (about 5-6 minutes, depending on the type or size of potatoes). The potatoes should be firm and not mushy.

7. Stir in the green peppers and onion, and continue to boil uncovered until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. The potatoes will continue to soak up the sauce even after being cooked. Stir in the 1 teaspoon sesame oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds.
