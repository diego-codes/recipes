# Vegan green bean hot dish

A perfect holiday dish, based off vegan recipes from [The Foodie Eats](https://thefoodieeats.com/vegan-green-bean-casserole/)


## Ingredients

- 8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, diced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- Pinch of black pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic minced
- 1 cup soy milk or oat milk
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1.5 tablespoon cornstarch
- 20 oz canned French-style green beans drained
- 4 oz French-fried onions


## Instructions

1. In a large sauce pan, add oil, mushrooms, garlic, salt, and pepper. Saute over medium-high heat for 10-15 minutes, until mushrooms have released their juices and liquid has mostly evaporated.

2. In a medium bowl, combine milk, onion powder, and cornstarch. Mix well, making sure there are no lumps.

3. Add milk mixture to mushrooms and reduce to medium-low heat. Cook until desired thickness is reached, probably about 5 minutes.

4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

5. In a medium casserole dish, combine mushroom cream blend with the green beans and half of the French-fried onions. Mix well to combine. Bake for about 25 minutes (should be hot and bubbling).

6. Remove dish from oven. Mix well again, then top with remaining French-fried onions.

7. Bake for another 10 minutes.
