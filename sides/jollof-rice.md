# Jollof rice

A Ghanaian version of this spicy staple, eat it with some sweet plantains and a protein on the side. This recipe comes from [Tasty](https://tasty.co/recipe/ghanaian-jollof-rice-as-made-by-tei-hammond).


## Ingredients:

- 2 large yellow onions, roughly chopped
- 1/3 cup + 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 2 (14 ounce) cans diced tomato
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 habanero pepper
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon mixed dried herbs
- 3 chicken bouillon cubes, crushed
- 2.5 cups long grain rice, rinsed
- 1 (12 ounce) bag frozen mixed vegetables
- 1.5 cups water


## Instructions

1. Roughly chop 2 onions into chunks.

2. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and a chunk of onion and pulse until smooth. Then add another onion chunk and repeat until the onions look like apple sauce. Open a window, as this may sting your eyes. Transfer onion slurry to a medium bowl.

3. Heat the remaining 1/3 cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.

4. Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water has cooked out and the puree starts to brown, about 15 minutes.

5. While the puréed onion is sautéing, add the 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender. Pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.

6. Stir in the tomato puree and add the 2 teaspoons curry powder, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon ginger, 1/2 teaspoon dried herbs, and 3 crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.

7. Add the uncooked but washed rice, bag of mixed vegetables, and 1.5 cups water. Stir, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed. Note that the rice on the bottom and sides of the pot will be a bit brown and crunchy - scrape and mix this in.
