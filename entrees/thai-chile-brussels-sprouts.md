# Thai chile Brussels sprouts

Inspired by Austin's [East Side King](https://www.keyingredient.com/recipes/2265695032/fried-brussel-sprouts-east-side-king/), these Brussels sprouts are tangy, sweet, spicy, perfect. While you can cook the Brussels sprouts in a pan, we prefer to [roast them](https://walkingonsunshinerecipes.com/how-to-make-easy-and-delicious-roasted/) in an oven or an air fryer.


## Ingredients

- 2 cup jasmine rice, dry
- 1 pound brussels sprouts, quartered
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- salt, to taste
- pepper, to taste
- 1 cup sweet chili sauce, preferably Mae Ploy brand
- 1 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 4 Thai chiles, minced
- 1/2 cup red cabbage, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup green cabbage, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup alfalfa sprouts
- 1/4 cup sweet onion, thinly sliced
- 1 large jalapeño pepper, thinly sliced
- salt, to taste
- 1/8 cup fresh mint leaves, torn
- 1/8 cup fresh cilantro leaves, torn
- 1/8 cup fresh basil leaves, torn


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil.

2. Wash and start cooking the 2 cups of rice.

3. Rinse and trim the pound of Brussels sprouts. Remove the outer leaves of the larger sprouts and slice the sprouts into quarters.

4. In a bowl, toss the Brussels sprouts with the 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper, to taste.

5. Place the 1 cup chili sauce, 1 cup vinegar, 1 clove minced garlic, and 4 minced Thai chiles in a small mixing bowl. Mix well and set aside.

6. Once the oven is hot, place the sprouts on the baking tray and roast in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sprouts are tender; tossing after 10 minutes. You want the sprouts to approach golden brown with the outside starting to char and get crispy.

7. While the sprouts are cooking, toss the 1/2 cup red and 1/2 cup green cabbage, 1/4 cup alfalfa sprouts, 1/4 cup sweet onion, and large jalapeño in a large mixing bowl.

8. Add the roasted brussels sprouts and half of the chili sauce mixture.

9. Season with salt to taste and garnish with the 1/8 cup mint, 1/8 cup cilantro, and 1/8 cup basil.

10. Serve the Brussels sprouts over rice, and set the remaining half of the chili sauce mixture on the side.
