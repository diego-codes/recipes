This hearty, warm salad bowl is based on [this recipe](https://www.thissavoryvegan.com/spicy-potato-kale-bowls-with-mustard-tahini-dressing/). Tastes great with our mustard tahini dressing recipe.


## Ingredients (for about 5 bowls)

For the sweet potatoes:
- 1 pound sweet potato, cut in bite-sized pieces
- 1/2 red onion, diced and separated in half
- 1 jalapeño, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- salt & pepper, to taste

For the salad:
- 4 cups kale, chopped and stems removed
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1/4 cup crunchy nuts, such as slivered almonds or chopped pecans


## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Combine the sweet potatoes, half of the red onion you diced, jalapeño, bell pepper, olive oil, paprika, and chili powder in a bowl. Stir to coat evenly. Spread mixture out on the baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.

3. After 20 minutes, remove from the oven and flip. Cook for an additional 10-20 minutes, or until sweet potatoes are crispy and veggies are soft.

4. Place the kale in a large bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice. Massage for 30-60 seconds, or until the lemon juice is incorporated and the kale is soft. Add nuts. Place in the fridge until ready to use.

5. Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and sprinkle with additional salt, if needed.
Assemble bowls by layering kale, the remaining raw red onion, and the sweet potato mix. Drizzle with dressing and serve.
