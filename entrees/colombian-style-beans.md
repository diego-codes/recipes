# Colombian-style beans

This tasty bean recipe is Diego's interpretation of comfort food. Serve with white rice, maduros (plantains), and arepas (cornmeal patties).


## Ingredients:

- 3/4 cup dry beans, such as lentils or pinto beans
- 1/4 onion, diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 roma tomatoes, diced
- 2 tablespoon oil
- 1 cup veggie broth
- 1 carrot, shredded
- Black pepper, to taste


## Instructions

1. Heat up a medium pot and add oil.

2. Saute onions til they become translucent, add garlic, then tomatoes.

3. Once these veggies are cooked down a bit, add the beans, shredded carrot, broth, and black pepper.

4. Cook beans and veggies down until beans are soft (about 2 hours). Alternatively, after the saute stage, add all ingredients to an instant pot and cook based on what your device recommends for the type of beans, plus 1 minute for good luck.
