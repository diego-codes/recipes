# Nasi goreng

Indonesian fried rice dish, often served with a side of pickled veggies or kimchi. Our recipe is based off [this Food Network recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/applink/recipes/food-network-kitchen/nasi-goreng-5482485). 


## Ingredients

- 1.5 cups (dry) or 3 cups (cooked and cooled) long grain rice
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 2 teaspoons sambal oelek, plus more for serving
- 3 tablespoons peanut oil
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- 12 ounces small shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 medium shallots, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 3 scallions, julienned and soaked in cold water
- 1 small carrot, julienned and soaked in cold water
- hoisin sauce, for serving


## Instructions

1. If cooking the rice, prepare according to package instructions. Cool and set aside (this can be done up to a day ahead).

2. Thinly slice 2 medium shallots and 2 cloves garlic. Julienne 3 scallions and 1 small carrot, then soak these in cold water. Beat 3 eggs in a bowl.

3. Mix 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, 2 teaspoons sambal oelek, and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl and set near the stove. Place all the remaining ingredients by the stove as well.

4. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a wok or large deep skillet over high heat. Add the beaten eggs and cook, swirling the pan but not stirring the eggs, so the eggs spread out to make a flat, set omelet, about 2 minutes.

5. Remove the omelet from the wok to the work surface, cool, and slice into strips.

6. Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the pan (or use a second pan) and, when hot, add the 12 ounces of shrimp and cook, stirring, until just pink, about 3 minutes.

7. Remove shrimp from the wok and chop coarsely. Wipe out any accumulated juices in the wok.

8. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the sliced shallots, sliced garlic, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander. Cook until the shallots are soft, about 2 minutes.

9. Add the 3 cups cooked rice along with the soy sauce mixture and stir to coat and combine.

10. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue stir-frying until the rice is heated through and lightly toasted, about 5 minutes.

11. Stir in the shrimp and egg strips and cook until just heated through.

12. Transfer to a platter and top with the drained scallions and carrots. Serve with more sambal oelek and hoisin, as desired.
