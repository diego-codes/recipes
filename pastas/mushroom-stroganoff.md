# Mushroom stroganoff

If the term 'umami bomb' wasn't already taken, it would be a perfect descriptor for this dish. This vegan stroganoff recipe is based on a [recipe from Tasty](https://tasty.co/recipe/mushroom-stroganoff).

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 12 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 fluid cups vegetable broth
- 1.5 fluid cups almond milk
- 8 ounces fusilli pasta, uncooked
- fresh parsley, chopped, for serving, garnish

## Instructions
1. In a large pot, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the diced yellow onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, until semi-translucent.

2. Add the 12 ounces sliced crimini mushrooms and cook until most of the juices have evaporated.

3. With your spoon, make a space in the center of the pot. Drizzle in the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and add the 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 tablespoon thyme, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

4. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. Add the 1/4 cup white wine and 1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and stir until incorporated.

5. Add 1/4 cup flour and stir until fully combined. Add the 2 cups vegetable broth, 1.5 cups almond milk, and pasta, and stir until well-combined.

6. Cover and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the liquid is creamy and pasta is cooked, stirring the whole time to prevent burning.

7. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley.
