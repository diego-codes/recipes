# Hummus toast

This recipe is a twist on avocado toast because some of us can't eat avocados.


## Ingredients

- 1 slice of crusty bread like country or sourdough
- Spreadable butter
- 1 tbsp. of neutral oil like sunflower or canola
- 1 egg
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Hummus to spread
- (Optional) Sriracha or Parmesan to top


## Instructions

1. Heat a small pan to medium heat.

2. Spread a very thin but even amount of butter on both sides of bread and place on pan. Toast for about 2 minutes on each side until sides are golden and crispy. If the bread has burnt parts, you can scrape it off with a knife. Set the bread aside.

3. Wipe the pan with a paper towel and lower the heat to medium-low.

4. Add 1 tbsp. of oil to fry egg. Add the egg, sprinkle salt and pepper to taste. Fry until desired doneness.

5. While the egg is cooking, spread hummus onto toast.

6. Once the egg is cooked to your liking place it on top of the toast with hummus.

7. Top with Sriracha or parmesan cheese for a final kick. Enjoy with a simple side salad!
