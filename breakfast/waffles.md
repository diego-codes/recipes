# Waffles

This waffle recipe (also suitable for pancakes) makes light, fluffy waffles perfect for absorbing the flavors of butter, maple syrup, or honey. I grew up calling them Cherie waffles, named after a family friend who provided the original version of the recipe.


## Ingredients (for about a dozen waffles or pancakes)

- 3 eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup butter, melted (plus a bit extra butter for pan cooking)
- 1 1/2 tbsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt


## Instructions

1. Whip the 3 eggs into a froth in a medium bowl.

2. Combine the other wet ingredients with the eggs and lightly whisk together.

3. Combine dry ingredients in a different bowl and mix them.

4. Whisk dry ingredients into wet ingredients, but just until there are no longer whisps of flour. Do not overmix the batter! Lumpiness is ok.

5. Let the batter rest for about 30 minutes.

6. Heat up a skillet to medium heat.

7. Melt a bit of butter on the skillet, and drop about 1/2 cup of batter for each waffle (or pancake).
